<h3>Operations</h3>
  <p>You can start an operation to attack another hacker or a company. Hacking another Hacker requires a high hacking skill to conquer the enemy's defenses. You can steal money from your victim if you succeed. Attacking others with your Botnet for a dDoS-Attack can deactivate the victim's systems on success. But beware! Failing an operation will cause your systems to reboot.</p>
